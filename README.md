## Build

Test suites are built automatically by the [.github/workflows/publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) action whenever a change are committed to the `main` branch.
A successful build results in a Docker container that is capable of running your tests on the CDP Platform and publishing the results to the CDP Portal.

## Run

The performance test suites are designed to be run from the CDP Portal.
The CDP Platform runs test suites in much the same way it runs any other service, it takes a docker image and runs it as an ECS task, automatically provisioning infrastructure as required.

## Local Testing with LocalStack

### Build a new Docker image

```bash
docker build . -t my-performance-tests
```

### Create a Localstack bucket

```bash
aws --endpoint-url=localhost:4566 s3 mb s3://my-bucket
```

### Run performance tests

```bash
docker run \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT='http://host.docker.internal:4566' \
  -e RESULTS_OUTPUT_S3_PATH='s3://my-bucket' \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='test' \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='test' \
  -e AWS_SECRET_KEY='test' \
  -e AWS_REGION='eu-west-2' \
  -e TEST_PROTOCOL='http' \
  -e TEST_HOSTNAME='host.docker.internal' \
  -e TEST_PORT=8080 \
  my-performance-tests
```

View test results at [s3://my-bucket](http://localhost:4566/my-bucket/index.html).
